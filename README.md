# README

This application is a simple build of an internal finance tool used at a small web application development company named Codelation. The finance tool keeps track of different project spenditures, finds their planned end date, and generates reports based off of those statistics.

The current build of this application only stores data (manipulated via ActiveAdmin) and displays a simple page with a project's statistics.
